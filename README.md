The Emailvalitation class is designed for email validation. The program includes methods to check various aspects of an email address, such as its length, uniqueness of the "@" symbol, allowed characters, and domain name. The program also includes methods to add and remove domain names from an ArrayList.
The PhoneNumberValidation class is designed for phone number validation․The "phoneNumbervalid" method is the main method for validating the phone number. It calls several other methods to check various aspects of the phone number, including the format, presence of a plus sign, Armenian country code, allowed symbols, and more․
The CreditCardsValitation class is for credit card validation․The program uses the Luhn algorithm to validate the credit card number. The Luhn algorithm is a simple checksum formula used to validate a variety of identification numbers, such as credit card numbers, IMEI numbers, and National Provider Identifier numbers. The algorithm works by summing up the digits in the number and then checking if the sum is divisible by 10. The program also checks the first digit of the credit card number to determine if it belongs to Visa, MasterCard, or American Express. The program uses regular expressions to validate the credit card number format and to remove any spaces or special characters from the input.
The DateValitation class is intended for date validation. The dateValid() method uses regular expressions to check whether the input date matches the required format. If it doesn't match, an exception is thrown and an error message is printed. If it does match, the method extracts the day, month, and year from the input string using regular expressions and checks whether the day is valid for the given month and year. If the day is invalid, an exception is thrown and an error message is printed. Finally, the method checks whether the year is a leap year and whether the input date is valid for that year. If the input date is not valid for a non-leap year, an exception is thrown and an error message is printed. The class also defines a LeepYear() method that takes an integer as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the year is a leap year.
The UrlValitation class is designed to check the validation of a url address․ The regular expression pattern used in this code checks whether the input URL starts with either "https://" or "http://", followed by an optional "www.", and then requires the domain name to consist of 2 to 256 characters from a range of valid characters, followed by a dot and a top-level domain (TLD) consisting of 2 to 6 lowercase letters. Finally, the pattern allows for optional path and query parameters that can consist of additional valid characters. If the input URL matches the required pattern, the method does nothing. If the input URL does not match the pattern, an exception is thrown and an error message is printed.
